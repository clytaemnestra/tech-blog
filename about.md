Hi there! I'm a software engineer and community events organizer.

As a software engineer I design & build backend systems that power data products. My strength lies in combining technical expertise with a product mindset and strong communication skills, allowing me to solve complex challenges within teams.

Beyond work, I'm the Vice Chair of the EuroPython Society, a non-profit organization behind the EuroPython conference. 

I’ve co-organized community events such as Pyvo, Python Pizza, EuroPython, and PyCon, driven by my passion for sharing knowledge and creating spaces where people can learn and collaborate. I deeply believe in the power of education, and organizing these events is my way of contributing to a more open and connected community.


I’m an experienced public speaker, having presented on technical topics at major conferences such as PyCon US, DjangoCon, and many European PyCons.
