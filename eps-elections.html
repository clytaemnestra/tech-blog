      <p>Inspired by the folks from the Django Software Foundation, namely <a href="https://www.paulox.net/2024/10/29/2025-django-software-foundation-board-nomination/">Paulo</a>, I decided to share more about my background, my motivations for running for the EuroPython Society Board, and the small improvements I’d like to see implemented this year.</p>

<h2 id="my-involvement-in-the-python-community">My Involvement in the Python Community</h2>

<p>Volunteering has been a big part of my life since I was 16. It all started when I attended a summer school on human rights and joined the Youth Initiative for Human Rights as a volunteer. Over time, I got involved with the Red Cross, a local feminist and LGBT-focused NGO during university, and later worked as a PR and business development manager for AIESEC.</p>

<p>When I moved to Prague and after a few years got enrolled into master studies in computer science, I was happy to find a way to volunteer in my field. The local Python community turned out to be incredibly helpful, welcoming and supportive, and I learned a lot throughout the years!</p>

<p>Here’s a quick summary of what I’ve been involved in so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pyvo (local Python meetups): At the end of 2021, I became the main organizer. Now, more people are helping, which has been great.</li>
  <li>EuroPython 2023: I started volunteering in late 2022, first advising on local matters and then organizing a one-day workshop.</li>
  <li>PyCon CZ 23: I worked on speaker management, media, and web development.</li>
  <li>Python Pizza: In 2024, I brought this event to the Czech Republic and was the main organizer.</li>
  <li>EuroPython 2024: I helped with the program, workshops, and events like the speaker’s dinner, evening drinks, and boat ride.</li>
  <li>I’ve spoken on technical topics at 8 Python conferences across three continents, including PyCon US, DjangoCon, EuroPython, PyCon Namibia, and European PyCons. I’ve also spoken at 4 events on general software engineering topics.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-i-volunteer">Why I Volunteer</h2>

<p>There are a few reasons why volunteering matters so much to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Belonging. I’ve always wanted to be part of a group of people who come together, full of creative energy, to make the world a better place.</li>
  <li>Meeting people. I love connecting with new people, especially at conferences!</li>
  <li>Learning. Volunteering is a great way to try new things and pick up skills like marketing, web development, or writing. Participating in conferences also keeps me up to date about current trends in software engineering.</li>
  <li>Meaning. I’ve worked in many environments, from small local businesses to big international corporations. While I enjoy solving problems by writing code, I’ve never felt like it truly made a difference in people’s lives. Volunteering gives me that sense of purpose, because I can directly help, influence and inspire.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-the-europython-society-board">About the EuroPython Society Board</h2>

<p>The EuroPython Society is led by a board of directors responsible for the EuroPython conference, the grants program, and more.</p>

<p>Organizing the EuroPython conference has given me so much in the last two years. I’ve made great connections, learned a lot, and had a wonderful time, especially in my first year.</p>

<p>But I’m also concerned about the future of the Society, particularly sustainability. Organizing the conference takes a lot of time and energy, and it’s hard to avoid burnout among board members.</p>

<p>The current board has recommended four key topics that are important for the Society’s future and sustainability:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hiring an Event Manager/Coordinator for EuroPython 2025</li>
  <li>Selecting a location for EuroPython 2026 and possibly 2027</li>
  <li>Enhancing community outreach towards European local Python communities</li>
  <li>Improving the fiscal and legal framework within the EuroPython Society</li>
</ol>

<p>When it comes to conference organization, the idea is to have a separate conference team. While we’re still not there, there’s still some work from the board required.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-running-for-the-board">Why Am I Running for the Board?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>To learn. I’ve been involved in non-profits for 13 years and want to understand more about how European non-profits work, especially on the legal and financial side. This could help me one day if I start my own non-profit or business.</li>
  <li>To grow. Volunteering has taught me a lot about working with people, and I think this role will help me improve even more.</li>
  <li>To give back. The Society has given me so much, and I’d like to contribute in return. I’ve seen small changes in other communities that could make a big difference here, and I’d love to help make them happen!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-changes-would-i-like-to-see">What Changes Would I Like to See?</h2>

<p>I don’t have big, revolutionary ideas to propose. Instead, the biggest thing I’d like to bring is focus. There have been many amazing ideas in the past, but we should focus on implementing one thing at a time. And that one thing should be the topics recommended by the previous Board, prioritized in the same order.</p>

<p>Clear goals, delivering measurable results, and transparency are the key.</p>

<p>There are also a few smaller but meaningful changes I’d like to see implemented. These are not the priority, nor are they something I personally commit to working on, but rather my Christmas wishlist to Santa.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yearly impact report. The PSF creates one each year (example <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/">here</a>), and it is very inspiring to see what they have achieved and how many people they have reached in just one year! I believe the EPS is very impactful, but there are no reports nor data yet. I’d really like to see similar reports at the EPS.</li>
  <li>Open board notes. The PSF has an <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/">open board archive</a> where you can browse previous notes and check them out. Making board meeting notes accessible could help build trust and make the board feel closer to its members.</li>
  <li>Data-driven decisions. There’s lots of data in the Society, but it’s unused. I’d love to see a warehouse with beautiful visualizations built on top of it, used by people to make data-driven decisions.</li>
  <li>Documentation, documentation, and more documentation. The Czech Python community has fantastic <a href="https://docs.pyvec.org/index.html">documentation</a> on everything from how to run meetups to how to handle finances. It’s a great example of how we could improve.</li>
  <li>Explore what EPS can do for other open-source projects. Python is special because of its huge and amazing ecosystem. While the Python Software Foundation sponsors and supports the development of the Python language - i.e., its main product is technical - and the Django Software Foundation sponsors Django, which is also technical, the EuroPython Society’s main product is the conference, i.e., an educational one. I think the EuroPython Society could also explore whether it could help European Python open-source developers and offer something beyond the conference - for example, fiscal sponsorship or know-how about European open-source laws and taxes.</li>
  <li>Bringing in new participants by focusing on the educational value. There are two aspects of the EuroPython conference: its amazing community and its top-tier content. It’s one of the biggest and best conferences in Europe, if you want to learn about Python. However, if you visit our <a href="https://ep2024.europython.eu/">website</a>, you’ll mostly see community-focused content. While I love the community spirit and want to keep it, I’d also want to highlight and promote the value of the educational content the conference offers.</li>
  <li>Bringing EuroPython to Southeastern Europe. I believe EuroPython brings so much to every place it visits and I saw it myself from both sides in the Czech Republic. If you look at the map of previous events, the conference was mostly held in Southern or Western Europe. Being originally from the Balkans, I would love to see EuroPython enrich a city like Zagreb, Ljubljana or Sofia.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-about-my-local-involvement">What About My Local Involvement?</h2>

<p>For the past three years, I’ve been actively involved with Pyvo. Recently, I’ve focused on bringing in new organizers, and a few people have started stepping up. I plan to take on more of a backup role and let others shine.</p>

<p>Python Pizza is now being organized in Brno by a new team consisting of <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/moisesguimaraes">Moisés</a>,  <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/anezkamll">Anežka</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jakub-balas-07a88a3a">Jake</a>, and I’m really happy that we created the <a href="https://docs.python.pizza/">documentation</a> (and it’s called Python Pizza Recipe!), so others can take over.</p>

<p>As for PyCon CZ, it’s taking a break in 2025. Instead, there will be PyCamp, organized by <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/hroncok">Miro</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/anezkamll">Anežka</a>, and <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/lum%C3%ADr-balhar-b173833a">Lumír</a>.</p>

<p>While I’m always happy to help locally if needed, my focus is shifting to global initiatives, where I can learn more and make a greater impact.</p>

<p>I love the art of public speaking and am always happy to share my knowledge by giving talks on technical topics. I plan to continue doing so!</p>

<p>No matter the outcome of the elections, I’m excited about EuroPython 2025 and I know it’s going to be an amazing event!</p>

<h2 id="get-in-touch">Get in Touch</h2>

<p>If you’d like to meet me in person, you can catch me at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pyvo-prague-python-meetup/events/">Pyvo</a> in Prague every third Wednesday of the month. I often attend conferences around Europe and the Czech Republic.</p>
