I've always liked to read. Over the years, it became a habit. Every month, I visit local bookstores to check out what's new.

The other day, I noticed a growing pile of books on my table, which got me thinking: it would be a nice idea to reflect on all the books I read in 2024.

I read 28 books in total. Some about life, some about career, and some on completely random topics. I didn't have any specific reading goals. I simply read whenever I felt like it, and I’m honestly surprised that last year I managed to read so much!

I decided to list all the books I read in 2024 below, starting with my absolute favorites. For each one, I shared what stood out to me the most.

At the end of this article, you can find out what my favorite book was, which one I disliked the most, and which surprised me in an unexpected way.

            <span>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Carnegie</span>
            <span class="chevron">▶️</span>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I read this book two years ago and was impressed by how many things were new to me. Because I learned so much from it, I decided to read it again. The book explains the core of human psychology—why we like some people and some we don't.</p>
            <p>One of the things that stood out to me the most is how important and powerful it is in human relationships to give honest appreciation. I was raised in an environment, both at home and school, where people were always quick to complain and criticize others. Unfortunately, this left its mark even in my adulthood. It’s easy for me to suggest improvements, but it doesn’t come naturally to stop, think about what’s working well, and appreciate people just because. This isn’t a common part of Eastern or Southeastern European culture either. I remember being in the U.S. and quite liking how people around me would comment on my clothes, hair, or random things they liked. I’m trying to work on this consciously and tell people when I notice something good or nice about them.</p>
            <p>Another big takeaway is how important it is to listen. I’m naturally not a great listener, and sometimes I tend to talk too much. But the truth is, no one really cares about me in that moment. Most people you talk to do so because they need to fill their own social needs—they enjoy talking—rather than because they’re deeply interested in you. This is important to remember. I’m trying to focus more on listening and asking questions when meeting someone new and, overall, toning down how much I talk about myself.</p>
            <p>The last key point that stood out to me is how to handle disagreements. We’ve all been in situations where we disagree with someone. The educational system taught me that discussions should be rational and focus on the arguments, so if I suggest <em>x</em> and you say it’s a bad idea and suggest <em>y</em>, we should write down the pros and cons of both approaches and figure out which one is best. However, human behavior has layers of subconscious demands, unspoken rules, and deep beliefs beneath the surface. The book suggests trying to understand people before disagreeing with them. Instead of focusing solely on facts, when I’m in disagreement with someone, I try to think about or ask what their core beliefs or values are. In other words, what they’re trying to convey beneath the thought we’re discussing.</p>
            <p>The book, overall, has many great insights into working with diverse people. I believe that knowing a lot about human nature while being honest, sincere, and authentic is what makes someone a great communicator and opens the door to better relationships in life.</p>

            <span>So Good They Can't Ignore You by Newport</span>
            <span class="chevron">▶️</span>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Why do some people enjoy their work, while for others it's just a 9-to-5 routine?</p>
            <p>There’s a myth that people are born with a passion for something. If you aren’t born with it, bad luck. However, Newport conducted research and found that it’s the other way round—when work makes someone happy, they become passionate about it. At that moment, it becomes a self-feeding loop that drives them forward.</p>
            <p>So, what makes people enjoy their work? He mentioned three key things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Autonomy – having control and being able to make your own decisions</li>
                <li>Competence – being good at what you do</li>
                <li>Social connections – feeling connected to those around you</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I personally can confirm this theory. The better I am at what I do, the more I enjoy it. In 2024, after many years, I started to truly enjoy my work. I have the autonomy to make decisions and I can fully contribute in meaningful ways. Best of all, I get to work with amazing colleagues and a supportive manager.</p>

            <span>Nonviolent Communication by Rosenberg</span>
            <span class="chevron">▶️</span>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I found out about this book by listening to <a href="https://nenasilnypodcast.cz/">Nenásilní podcast</a>. The basic idea behind nonviolent communication is pretty simple. There are four key components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Observations – actions we observe around us</li>
                <li>Feelings – how we feel in relation to those observations</li>
                <li>Needs – all our feelings and human behavior are driven by our needs</li>
                <li>Requests – specific actions we can take to fulfill our needs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The biggest lesson I took from the book is to avoid labeling, criticizing, or judging people. Saying things like <em>He's lazy</em> or <em>She's selfish</em> never helps but makes the situation worse.</p>
            <p>Another valuable takeaway is learning to recognize my needs and think about how to fulfill them. For example, if I feel angry because something didn’t happen, I ask myself: what need was that supposed to fulfill and what other ways could I fulfill that need at this moment?</p>

It’s about our relationships with all the other things in our lives: our family, work, friends, animals, money, own bodies, time, the world, spirituality, and even death.</p>
            <p>The book explains why these relationships matter and why it’s important to understand what your relationship is with these things and what previous life events shaped it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>If you're interested in public speaking, there's no better material than this book! Its author is the head of TED - a non-profit organization known for hosting some of the most popular and highest-quality talks in the world.</p>
            <p>What surprised me most about TED Talks is how hard it is to get to the main stage. Even after their topic is selected, speakers must go through a trial rehearsal, and if their talks don’t meet the quality requirements, they aren’t allowed to proceed further. Some time ago, I considered buying a ticket for the main TED conference, but when I found out the cheapest one costs $6,250, I quickly lost interest.</p>

            <p>Why do some groups work better than others? This book shared many fascinating stories about different groups and what made some of them successful.</p>
            <p>One concept that stood out to me the most was <em>bad apple</em> behavior. We've all been part of groups where there was that one person who needed to be managed by everyone else but was somehow tolerated. This is also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair">missing stair</a> metaphor—the idea of an issue everyone knows about but works around rather than fixing.</p>
            <p>The author referenced a study where researchers examined what happens when you place such a person in a successful group. The result? Productivity drops by 30-40%. The key difference between long-term successful groups and less effective ones is that successful groups openly call out this behavior and actively address it rather than letting it slide.</p>

            <span class="chevron">▶️</span>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When I attended PyCon in Namibia last year, we spent a day teaching high-school students in Katutura. I wrote an article about my trip to Namibia here.</p>
            <p>Katutura is a township established in the 1960s when the South African colonial administration forcibly relocated Windhoek's Black population to the suburbs. In Herero, <em>Katutura</em> means <em>The place where people do not want to live</em>.</p>
            <p>The book is filled with photos and stories about life in Katutura, but one story from a resident really stood out to me. Life in Katutura is harsh and people live in difficult conditions. However, one resident shared an interesting observation: despite the hardships, people in Katutura live in a close-knit community where people help each other. In contrast, in areas predominantly inhabited by white Namibians, you often see large houses with fences, cameras, and guard dogs, and people rarely interact with each other.</p>
            <p>If you ever visit Namibia, I highly recommend attending PyCon and visiting Katutura with locals. It is a tough place to see, especially when you realize the extent of the injustices of the past, but it will shift your perspective on yourself and everything you have.</p>

            <p>This is such a great book about communities! While some parts felt obvious, as I've been part of communities from the age of nine, it provided a clear framework and introduced me to the concept of paid community management, which often works differently from volunteer-led communities. I learned about different types of communities, management strategies, how it works in large companies and the roles available in this field.</p>

            <p>What would you guess is the epidemic causing declining health in the Western world today? Obesity? Opioids? Drugs?</p>
            <p>It’s loneliness! The author explains why it’s such a significant issue and how it affects human health. According to him, humans need three types of connections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The inner circle, core relationships – family, partner(s) and closest friends</li>
                <li>The middle circle, close relationships – friends, colleagues and extended family members</li>
                <li>The outer circle, casual relationships – broader community, acquaintances</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One fascinating point was how different cultures perceive human relationships. The author used the <em>bowl</em> metaphor: in some cultures, like a deep bowl, you're born into many connections—it’s easy to form bonds, but there’s little freedom, and you’re expected to fit in. In contrast, shallow bowl cultures require you to create connections consciously; they don’t happen automatically, but there’s much more personal freedom.</p>
            <p>I’ve experienced both. Growing up in a small town in the Balkans, everyone knew everyone. It was a close-knit ecosystem where people helped each other and stayed connected, but there was immense pressure to conform—if you stood out, you felt it. Now, living in Prague, I can be whoever I want, but I don’t know a single neighbor, let alone to casually visit them for coffee.</p>
            <p>Another interesting point was the impact of loneliness on the elderly. The more developed a country is, the more individualistic its people tend to be. In places like Norway, elders often expect to live alone and are accustomed to it. But in countries like Italy, where older generations grew up in households with extended family, the shift toward individualism creates a painful gap. As the culture changes, their expectations remain, leaving them more vulnerable to loneliness.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in open-source, I highly recommend this book! One of the most interesting insights was that there are four types of open-source projects:</p>

                <li>Federations – high user growth and high contributor growth (e.g., Kubernetes)</li>

            <span>Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It by Voss</span>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This book is written by a professional FBI negotiator.</p>
            <p>One of the most fascinating points I remember is the importance of honesty and keeping promises. An interesting example is how the FBI ensures that if they promise someone a reduced prison sentence in exchange for releasing hostages, they follow through. The reason is surprising—it’s all about reputation! If the FBI fails to keep their word, the person they convinced could share that with others in prison, damaging the FBI’s credibility. Since many criminals spend time in prison, maintaining a consistent and trustworthy reputation is crucial for the FBI’s brand.</p>
            <p>Another interesting technique discussed in the book is the use of mirroring and voice control.</p>
            <p>Mirroring means labeling the other person’s emotions (e.g., <em>It sounds/feels/seems like you’re feeling xxx?</em>) to encourage them to share more. The author says it's very important to actively listen (and not speak) during negotiations. It's because you need information to make good decisions, and the more you listen, the more you learn, therefore the better your chances of success.</p>
            <p>The author also explains that there are three types of voices used during negotiations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The late-night DJ voice – calm, slow, and deep, used to make a strong point</li>
                <li>The positive/playful voice – the default voice, which you can create by smiling while you speak</li>
                <li>The assertive and direct voice – it should never be used, as it tends to create pushback</li>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Cultural differences can be seen in many areas, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication – low-context vs. high-context</li>
                <li>Evaluating – direct vs. indirect negative feedback</li>
                <li>Persuading – principles-first vs. applications-first</li>
                <li>Leading – egalitarian vs. hierarchical</li>
                <li>Decision-making – consensual vs. top-down</li>
                <li>Trusting – task-based vs. relationship-based</li>
                <li>Disagreeing – confrontational vs. avoids confrontation</li>
                <li>Scheduling – linear-time vs. flexible-time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One example from the book really stood out to me. I was born into a high-context culture, where communication is indirect, and you’re expected to read between the lines. For instance, in these cultures, people may ask multiple times if you want coffee or even try to persuade you, because saying <em>no</em> once isn’t enough. Responsibility for the exchange doesn’t lie solely with the person asking but with both people involved.</p>
            <p>I prefer direct communication, so not having to constantly read between the lines feels refreshing. However, my experience of living in a high-context culture has shaped me—I often find myself questioning the hidden motivations behind people’s actions, even when none exist.</p>
            <p>It’s fascinating how cultures differ in how they communicate, and this book helped me understand why.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I read Surrounded by Idiots by Erikson a few years ago, and it was one of the best books I’ve ever read!</p>
            <p>This book focuses on understanding narcissism and how to protect yourself from narcissistic behavior.</p>
            <p>One of the things that stood out to me is how narcissists exploit people’s weaknesses, which is why it’s important to understand your own ones and be prepared. For example, a common tactic is to shift the focus of the conversation to you. If you’re impatient and start getting angry, they will steer the conversation toward your reaction rather than the issue at hand. The key is to stay calm and call them out. The author also suggests having witnesses present (since narcissists care about their image), pausing the conversation, setting clear boundaries, or, in some cases, cutting off contact altogether.</p>
            <p>Another surprising point is how society as a whole is becoming more narcissistic. Even people who don’t have narcissistic disorder often display narcissistic tendencies, and collective narcissism is on the rise. The author suggests that the self-help industry and social media may be contributing factors.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in ADHD, this book is definitely worth a read.</p>
            <p>Right at the start, the author introduces an intriguing theory: that our hunter-gatherer ancestors had traits commonly associated with ADHD, and those traits were actually advantageous at the time. As hunters, they needed to be flexible, seek novelty, remain curious, stay active, and be hyperfocused when hunting. However, as society transitioned to agriculture, the traits that were beneficial for hunting became less relevant. Farmers, on the other hand, needed to focus on a single task for long periods each day: farming.</p>
            <p>The book also includes plenty of practical tools and techniques for managing daily life more effectively.</p>
            <p>One exercise stood out to me as particularly useful. The book explains how our needs drive our behavior and provides a long list of common human needs. The exercise asked readers to write down 5-6 situations where they lost their temper and identify which need was not met in each case. The next step was to list activities that could fulfill that need. Interestingly, I discovered that for me, all the situations traced back to the same unmet need, and now I have a better understanding of how to address it.</p>

          <span>Feminist Fight Club: An Office Survival Manual for a Sexist Workplace by Bennett</span>
          <span class="chevron">▶️</span>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
          <p>When I was walking the streets of Manhattan last May, I accidentally stumbled upon a second-hand bookshop and bought this book for just one dollar. Then, I went to Central Park to enjoy some nature surrounded by skyscrapers (a very unique contrast!) and started reading it.</p>
          <p>The book explains how to handle sexist behavior in the workplace.</p>
          <p>My biggest takeaway was that how we speak is often more important than what we say. The author referenced studies showing that women tend to ask for permission more often than for forgiveness, which also shows up in language. For instance, women are more likely to end sentences with phrases like <em>Does that make sense?</em> while men tend to say <em>Here’s what we’re going to do</em>.</p>
          <p>A few times since reading it, when I caught myself wanting to seek confirmation for a decision I’d already made, I remembered that advice and held my ground.</p>

          <p>The whole history of psychology, simply explained! I really loved the visuals and how the information was presented. If you're interested in any subject, I highly recommend the "Big Ideas Simply Explained" series.</p>
          <p>It's also fascinating and disturbing how inhumane psychology was in the past. It makes me wonder what practices from today will be frowned upon 50 years from now?</p>

      </div>
      <div class="content">
          <p>Šebek is a Czech surgeon and entrepreneur who has participated in multiple missions with Doctors Without Borders. I’ve read all his previous books about these missions, and it’s always fascinating to learn about the challenging environments in which surgeons have to operate.</p>
          <p>Each chapter of this book is divided into three parts—Šebek’s upbringing, a story from one of his missions, and a story about his life with his wife and children. While Šebek is often seen as a hero, in this book, he tries to debunk that image by portraying himself honestly and openly. He talks about practices during missions that would land him in prison in the Czech Republic (like using candle wax to seal someone’s heart) or infidelity and complicated relationships with his children.</p>
          <p>Despite his efforts to show his mistakes and all his failures, I still admire Šebek’s achievements.</p>
          <p>The book motivated me to research more about Doctors Without Borders and consider joining a similar organization in the future.</p>

      <div class="content">
          <p>We all need relationships with others to live healthy and happy lives. Relationship attachment refers to the emotional bond between a child and their parents or, later in life, between a person and their romantic partner(s).</p>
          <p>There are three main types of attachment styles that explain how easily we connect with others:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Secure attachment – the ability to form strong bonds, care about others, and feel comfortable</li>
              <li>Anxious attachment – characterized by constant worry and a need for reassurance</li>
              <li>Avoidant attachment – difficulty sharing feelings and a tendency to distance oneself</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The good news is that, regardless of your attachment style, it can evolve with enough self-awareness, effort, and therapy.</p>

          <p>If you’d like to learn more about ADHD from the perspective of a neurotypical partner of someone with ADHD, I recommend this book. It explores the impact of untreated ADHD on loved ones in an honest way.</p>
          <p>What stood out to me the most was how often ADHD is misdiagnosed and the profound effect this has on people’s lives and their closest family members. The book also highlights how life can change—for both the person with ADHD and their loved ones—once they start managing it with medication and therapy.</p>

          <p>This book is about reframing obstacles as challenges and shifting your mindset to see them as opportunities for growth.</p>
          <p>One quote that really stuck with me is: <em>Every obstacle is an opportunity to practice some virtue: patience, courage, humility, resourcefulness, reason, justice, and creativity.</em> As someone who’s naturally impatient, it helps me to remind myself, when something makes me angry, that it’s just a test of my patience, nothing more.</p>
          <p>That said, I didn’t quite enjoy the book because there was too much fluff for my taste.</p>

<h2>My Favorite, Most Disliked, and The Most Surprising Book in 2024</h2>
<p>My favorite book in 2024 was Prostě vztahy (Just Relationships) by Honza Vojtko. I remember reading about the oldest Harvard study on happiness, which showed that what truly makes people happy is having meaningful relationships. I really enjoyed this book. Not only for the author’s style but also for how it made me reflect for days on things I usually don’t think much about, like how much time and energy I invest in friendships, my stance on spirituality, and my relationship with death. I also highly recommend the author’s other books and talks—they will challenge and change how you view relationships.</p>
<p>The book I disliked the most was Mastery by Robert Greene. It’s the only book I couldn’t finish. The author included many stories about evolution, trying to tie them to the concept of mastery, but I couldn’t see any meaningful connection. To me, the book felt full of survivorship bias, cherry-picked stories about famous people, and motivational claims that lacked evidence. I also found the writing overly verbose—it felt like he used ten pages to explain what could have been said in a single sentence. Unfortunately, whatever mastery the author has in writing remained lost on me.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise, however, was Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss. I expected it to be full of negotiation tactics for high-stakes meetings I’d never be part of, but instead, I learned so many practical tips for everyday life. I also really enjoyed the author’s writing style—engaging, clear, and memorable. After reading the book, I watched his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjhDkNmtjy0">TED talk</a>, which was both funny and fascinating. I highly recommend checking it out.</p>
<p>I hope this inspires you to pick up a book or two! What was your favorite book in 2024? Do you have any recommendations to share? Let me know!</p>
