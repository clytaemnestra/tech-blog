<h1 id="dublin">Dublin</h1>
<p>I landed in Dublin the day before the conference. It rained all afternoon. I went to the nearest gas station to grab something quick and thought I’d head to the city, but after a few minutes outside, I was completely soaked, water literally dripping off me. I gave up and stayed in the hotel.</p>

<p><img src="./images/posts/djangocon2/rain.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 100%; display: block;" /></p>

<p>The rest of the week was much better! No rain, just lively evenings and packed pubs. What I love about Dublin is how it feels cosy yet alive, with people spilling out of pubs, laughing and chatting late into the night.</p>

<h2 id="guinness">Guinness</h2>
<p>The first time I tried Guinness was years ago in Bratislava. We were wandering around with old colleagues, and the only open place after midnight was a shabby pub filled with old men shouting at football players on a TV. They served maybe three kinds of beer. A colleague told me to try Guinness. Worst. Beer. Of. My. Life. And I’ve tried many. (Not exactly proud of that.)</p>

<p>I tried a few in Dublin, and they were completely different! Very creamy and tasty. Apparently, they use nitrogen instead of CO₂ in Ireland, and that’s why they taste so different.</p>

<p>Whenever I was out, I mostly drank Guinness. Even now, I’m writing this post while sipping my last pint at the airport. Definitely leaving on a high note.</p>

<h1 id="djangocon">DjangoCon</h1>
<h2 id="my-keynote-talk">My Keynote Talk</h2>
<p>One day, I got an email invitation from <a href="https://www.mariuszfelisiak.org/">Mariusz Felisiak</a> to give a keynote talk at DjangoCon. Since it’s my favorite community conference and I love giving talks, I couldn’t say no!</p>

<p>So I started thinking about the topic. I wanted something technical but also fun and engaging. One night, lying in bed, the idea hit me: bizarre software bugs! The weird ones, the tragic ones, the funny ones. Bugs that teach something and entertain. Perfect keynote material!</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="./images/posts/djangocon2/rmrf.png" alt="Large mural depicting historical scenes in Wrocław" style="max-width: 99%; height: auto;" />
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Working on the talk was so much fun! I’ve always loved the arts (and even have some formal education in it), and I really enjoy how public speaking brings together technical research, storytelling, visuals, and performance all in one.</p>

<p>Some examples were space-themed, and I love reading more about spacecraft or planes, like NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter crash or the Boeing Max disaster (hint: yes, it was software!).</p>

<p>During the preparation, I learned many fascinating things. For example, do you know why planes don’t have square windows? If you don’t, check it out!</p>

<h2 id="speakers-dinner">Speakers’ Dinner</h2>
<p>The night before the conference, we had the speakers’ dinner at a classic Irish pub. They were serving burgers only, but luckily there was a veggie option for me.</p>

</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After dinner, we went to a nearby pub for a pint of Guinness. Paolo took a photo of me around 9 pm, and you can clearly see how exhausted I looked the night before my talk.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="the-talk-day">The Talk Day</h2>
<p>I fell asleep at 3 am and woke up at 6. I went to the auditorium expecting maybe ten people to show up, since it was 9 am after all. To my biggest surprise, the room was so packed that people were standing, with no empty seats left!</p>

<p>I thought a few of my slides might be funny, but the audience laughed and followed my stories the whole way. It felt amazing!</p>

<p>Afterwards, many folks came up and shared more bizarre bug stories with me. Might have to do a second part next year! Big thanks to everyone for sharing your stories with me!</p>

<h2 id="other-talks">Other Talks</h2>
<h3 id="haki-benita">Haki Benita</h3>
<p>I loved <a href="https://hakibenita.com/">Haki Benita’s</a> talk. He spent half an hour talking about foreign keys only.</p>

<p>Turns out I’d read his articles on Django and concurrency before and hadn’t even made the connection. He used to work as a DBA and brings a super unique angle to his talks, especially things Django sometimes does less efficiently.</p>

<p>Once the video is out, I want to go through it step by step and take notes, as there were so many practical takeaways. Highly recommend!</p>

<h3 id="sarah-boyce">Sarah Boyce</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sarahboyce">Sarah</a>, one of the Django Fellows, gave a keynote on contributing to Django through code reviews.</p>

<p>I like doing reviews and usually do them before sleep (weird, I know), so it made me think about getting more involved with open source. A lot of projects don’t lack PRs. They lack reviewers. PRs pile up and reviewing is often the bottleneck.</p>

<h3 id="karen-jex">Karen Jex</h3>
<p><a href="https://karenjex.blogspot.com/">Karen</a> always gives great talks! This year, she asked for ideas on what to cover, and I suggested “how databases work under the hood.” She opened her talk with a slide quoting me!</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="./images/posts/djangocon2/karen.jpg" alt="Large mural depicting historical scenes in Wrocław" style="max-width: 99%; height: auto;" />
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Loved her talk! I’ve read Designing Data-Intensive Applications and PostgreSQL Internals, but still learned something new. If you’re into databases, don’t miss her talk once it’s out!</p>

<h2 id="swimming-in-the-ocean">Swimming in the Ocean</h2>
<p>After day one of sprints, there’s a tradition: swim in the ocean. I totally forgot about it. I didn’t have any swimwear, towel, or anything with me.</p>

<p>I went with <a href="https://thib.me/about/">Thibaud</a> and <a href="https://carrick.eu/">Tom</a> who did go in, and standing there watching them made me want to join. I walked into the ocean up to my knees. It was so cold that my legs went instantly numb. Which is good, because then you don’t feel the pain.</p>

<p>Next year, I’m bringing swimwear and going in for the full challenge!</p>

<h1 id="djangos-birthdays">Django’s Birthdays</h1>
<p>Did you know Django turns 20 this year? On July 14, the same day EuroPython starts!</p>

<p>Thibaud made these adorable DIY photo frames and stickers, including a Django pony wearing the EuroPython Society logo. Super cute!</p>

<p>The Django Software Foundation will have a booth at EuroPython again this year, alongside EPS. I can’t wait to see what fun stuff they bring!</p>
